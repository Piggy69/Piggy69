- ðŸ‘€ Hi! After more than 20 years career I still love programming.
- 
- I am very interested in IoT and I am currently developing an IoT Software Platform.
- I am also very interested in developing software for Financial Markets.

The technologies I prefer are .Net/.NetCore, Visual Studio, SQL Server, Azure... and more.
